# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project overview
In this project I made an add user app using React Hooks and Redux(state management library)
I have iplemented user registration and login functionality where i am storing user data as a token in the localStorage when the user clicks 'Logout' button the key 'token-info' get removed and user can no longer access the Home, Add User and Delete User pages.

There are basically 6 components i have used which are inside src/pages directory, Login, Register, Home, AddUser, EditUser, and an ErrorHandler component to show handle if there's any error on the UI and reflect an Error page instead of breaking the UI.

I used store, reducer, and action of react-redux library for the state management, whenever there is some change on the UI the view dispatches an action corresponding to that, and it goes to the store where using the current state, and actionType the reducer updates the state, and all the components which are subscribed to this stae gets updated.
